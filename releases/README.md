## Releases
+ [linux_arm64/moblink-rust-relay](linux_arm64/moblink-relay) for devices like orange pi, radxa
+ [linux_x86_64/moblink-rust-relay](linux_x86_64/moblink-relay) for devices using a typical x86_x64 architecture like normal PCs or radxa X4
+ [linux_mips_musl/moblink-rust-relay](linux_mips_musl/moblink-relay) for devices using openwrt like GL-XE300

### Important Note
since version 0.7.0 the binaries are called `moblink-relay` instead of `moblink-rust-relay`

I will leave the old version for now as this could be a good chance for a fallback binary in case something is wrong with a new release
